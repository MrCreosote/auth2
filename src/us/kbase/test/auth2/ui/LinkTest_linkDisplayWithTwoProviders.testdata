<h3>Link account</h3>


<p> You can link a new identity provider account to your currently logged-in
account, <strong>u1</strong>, here. Note that some providers will
automatically redirect you back
here if you are already logged in to that provider. If the logged-in
provider account is not the account you wish to link, you must visit the
provider and logout <strong>before</strong> starting the linking process.

<p>Identity providers:<p>

<form action="start" method="post">
	<input type="radio" name="provider" value="prov1"/>prov1<br/>
	<input type="radio" name="provider" value="prov2"/>prov2<br/>
	<input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
</form>

You will be redirected to the identity provider website where you will be asked
to allow us to view your account information - your account ID, email
address, and name.<br/>
You will have 30 minutes to complete the identity provider's login process.
